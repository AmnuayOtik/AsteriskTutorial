1. Call Center with Queue
In Asterisk, queues are used to manage incoming calls by placing them in a queue to be answered by available agents. You can use the Queue() application in the dialplan to handle calls within a queue system. Below is an example of how to configure a queue in the Asterisk dialplan:

1.1. Define a Queue in queues.conf
First, you need to define the queue and its options in the queues.conf file.

[Queue-After-Services]
musicclass = default            ; Music class to play while waiting
strategy = ringall              ; Ring all available agents
timeout = 15                    ; Timeout before trying the next agent
retry = 5                       ; Time to wait before retrying the queue
maxlen = 5                      ; Maximum callers allowed in the queue
wrapuptime=30000                ; 30 seconds wrap-up time

joinempty = yes                 ; Allow joining the queue even if no agents are available
leavewhenempty = no             ; Leave the queue if no agents are available
queue-youarenext = queue-youarenext  ; Announcement for position in the queue
queue-thankyou = queue-thankyou      ; Announcement when leaving the queue
queue-callswaiting = queue-callswaiting ; Announcement for calls waiting
announce-frequency = 30       ; How often to announce queue position

In this example:
- The [Queue-After-Services] queue is defined with various options like music on hold, ring strategy, and timeout values.

2. Queue Members
    2.1 Static Queue Members
    Static members are predefined in the queues.conf configuration file. They are always part of the queue unless removed manually.

    Example of static members in queues.conf:

    [myqueue]
    strategy = ringall
    timeout = 15
    retry = 5
    maxlen = 5

    ; Static members (always part of the queue)
    member => PJSIP/200
    member => PJSIP/201

    In this example, the endpoints PJSIP/200 and PJSIP/201 will always be part of the queue myqueue.

    2.2 Dynamic Queue Members
    Dynamic members can log in and out of the queue. This is useful for agents who may not always be available.

    Dialplan for Dynamic Queue Members:
    You can add or remove queue members dynamically using the AddQueueMember() and RemoveQueueMember() applications in the dialplan.

    Add Queue Member

    exten => 6001,1,Answer()
    exten => 6001,n,AddQueueMember(myqueue,PJSIP/${CALLERID(num)})  ; Add the caller’s endpoint to the queue
    exten => 6001,n,Playback(agent-loginok)                         ; Playback confirmation of login
    exten => 6001,n,Hangup()

    In this example:

    An agent can call extension 6001 to log into the queue myqueue.
    The agent's endpoint is added to the queue based on their Caller ID.
    Remove Queue Member

    exten => 6002,1,Answer()
    exten => 6002,n,RemoveQueueMember(myqueue,PJSIP/${CALLERID(num)}) ; Remove the caller’s endpoint from the queue
    exten => 6002,n,Playback(agent-loggedoff)                         ; Playback confirmation of logout
    exten => 6002,n,Hangup()


5. Queue Strategies
Asterisk offers different queue strategies that determine how calls are distributed to agents. You can set these strategies in the queues.conf file.

- ringall: Ring all available agents until one answers.
- leastrecent: Ring the agent who has been idle the longest.
- fewestcalls: Ring the agent with the fewest completed calls.
- random: Ring a random agent.
- rrmemory: Round robin with memory (it remembers the last agent that answered and continues from there).

strategy = ringall   ; Or other strategies like leastrecent, fewestcalls, etc.


6. Agent Announcement
You can also configure Asterisk to announce the caller’s position in the queue using the announce-position and announce-holdtime options in the queues.conf.

announce-position = yes
announce-holdtime = yes
announce-frequency = 30     ; Announce queue position every 30 seconds


Complete Example: Asterisk Queue Dialplan
Here’s a full working example:

edit : /etc/asterisk/queues.conf

[Queue-After-Services]
musicclass = default
strategy = ringall
timeout = 15
retry = 5
maxlen = 5
joinempty = yes
leavewhenempty = no
announce-position = yes
announce-holdtime = yes
announce-frequency = 30


edit : /etc/asterisk/extensions.conf

[Queue-Services]
exten => 6600,1,Answer()
exten => 6600,n,Queue(Queue-After-Services)
exten => 6600,n,Hangup()

exten => 6601,1,Answer()
exten => 6601,n,AddQueueMember(Queue-After-Services,PJSIP/${CALLERID(num)})
exten => 6601,n,Playback(agent-loginok)
exten => 6601,n,Hangup()

exten => 6602,1,Answer()
exten => 6602,n,RemoveQueueMember(Queue-After-Services,PJSIP/${CALLERID(num)})
exten => 6602,n,Playback(agent-loggedoff)
exten => 6602,n,Hangup()

This setup will create a queue system where agents can log in and log out dynamically, and callers will be placed in the queue with announcements about their position and hold time.
