1. Asterisk cmd Record

The Record() command in Asterisk is used to record audio from a call and save it to a file. This can be useful for recording voicemail greetings, IVR prompts, or any other audio needed for future playback.

Basic Syntax
exten => <extension>,n,Record(<filename>.<format>[,<silence>[,<maxduration>[,<options>[,<offset>]]]])

Parameters:
- filename: 
    The name of the file where the recording will be saved (do not include the path). The file will be saved in the Asterisk sounds directory.
- format: 
    The audio file format (e.g., wav, ulaw, gsm). Asterisk will save the file in this format.
- silence (optional): 
    The number of seconds of silence after which recording will stop (e.g., 5 means the recording will stop if there is 5 seconds of silence).
- maxduration (optional): 
    The maximum duration of the recording in seconds. If omitted, the recording will continue indefinitely unless terminated by a key press or silence.
- options (optional): 
    Additional options to control the behavior of the recording (see below). offset (optional): The number of samples from the beginning of the file where the recording will start.

Options:
a: Append to an existing file rather than overwriting it.
n: Do not answer the channel before recording.
q: Quiet mode. Don't play a beep before starting the recording.
s: Stop recording after silence (used with the silence parameter).
t: Allow the recording to be terminated with the # key.
x: Ignore the * key for exit.

The file is saved in the /var/lib/asterisk/sounds/ directory by default unless otherwise specified.
By using the Record() command, you can easily record audio for various use cases in your Asterisk dialplan.

*** No application 'Record' ******
The error message pbx_extension_helper: No application 'Record' for extension means that the Record() application is not available in your Asterisk installation. This typically happens when the necessary modules are not loaded or installed.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the app_record.so Module is Loaded
The Record() application is provided by the app_record.so module in Asterisk. To check if it is loaded, use the following command from the Asterisk CLI:

asterisk -rx "module show like record"


If you do not see app_record.so in the output, the module is not loaded.

2. Load the app_record.so Module
If the module is installed but not loaded, you can load it manually using the following Asterisk CLI command:

asterisk -rx "module load app_record.so"

3. Check if the Module is Installed
If loading the module fails, the module might not be installed. You need to recompile Asterisk with the app_record module included. Follow these steps:
